# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version 0.10, 0.12 or 4

## Install Package

```

# Quick Start

`GET /your/api/{param}/call`

```javascript
var Client = require('sendgrid-rest').Client
var client = new Client()
var request = client.emptyRequest()
var param = 'myparam'
request.host = 'api.example.com'
request.method = 'GET'
request.path = '/your/api/' + param + '/call'
client.API(request, function (response) {
  console.log(response.statusCode)
  console.log(response.body)
  console.log(response.headers)
})
```

`POST /your/api/{param}/call` with headers, query parameters and a request body.

```javascript
var Client = require('sendgrid-rest').Client
var client = new Client()
var request = client.emptyRequest()
request.host = 'api.example.com'
request.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer XXXXXX'
request.queryParams['limit'] = 100
request.queryParams['offset'] = 0
request.method = 'POST'
var param = 'myparam'
request.path = '/your/api/' + param + '/call'
requestBody = {
  'some': 0,
  'awesome': 1,
  'data': 3
}
request.body = requestBody
client.API(request, function (response) {
  console.log(response.statusCode)
  console.log(response.body)
  console.log(response.headers)
})
```
